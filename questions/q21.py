#Write a Python program to print the following 'here document'.
print("""A here document (or "heredoc") is a way of specifying a text block,  
preserving the line breaks, indents, and other whitespace within the text.
The said code uses triple quotes to define a multi-line string, 
also known as a heredoc string. It allows the string to span multiple lines 
without the need to escape newline characters.
